# Live-Retro-Webcam
This is site where the webcam feed will appear in pixelated formats. I have add several palettes also

# How it works
## Pixelation 
I used Canvas API to make an empty canvas and then draw an frame on smaller resolution. 
This made up the pixelated images.  
What makes an pixel art truly retro is __limited Color Palette !!__  
For this I used euclidean distance, treating rgb value of video frame as an point in 3D.

# Differnt Palettes
The logic above allowed for palettes and I then added different color palettes.
